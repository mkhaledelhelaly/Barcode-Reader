# Introduction
For the development of our barcode processing system, an object-oriented programming approach is adopted for handling the complexity and modularity of the code. Our system will handle generic pre-processing of captured images and specifically focus on the distortions of several types of images containing barcodes. <br>
Detection and Analysis: We utilize the AnalyzeImage class to detect and flag issues within the image. This class is equipped with methods to identify problems like blurriness, low or high contrast, presence of noise (salt and pepper noise), and to detect if there are obstructions or if the image is rotated. <br>
Preprocessing: The PreprocessImage class is responsible for applying corrective measures based on the flags raised by AnalyzeImage. It includes methods for operations such as cropping, straightening, contrast enhancement, noise removal, and handling of lighting conditions, ensuring the image is as clear and usable as possible. <br>
Frequency Domain Corrections: We've implemented the ImageFrequencyTransformer class to deal with issues in the frequency domain. This class helps in removing periodic noise and enhancing image details that might not be visible through simple spatial domain processing. <br>
Integration: All these components are combined within the ImageProcessor class, which orchestrates the sequence of operations. This class manages the workflow by first analyzing the image for issues, then applying the necessary preprocessing steps from both PreprocessImage and ImageFrequencyTransformer to correct those issues. <br>
We have also provided an implementation for TestBatchImageProcessor for testing purposes, allowing us to process several images in batch mode. This helps us in testing our system on a wide range of images for robustness and reliability. We have also created an ImageProcessingGUI using customtkinter for interactive and user-friendly operation. This provides a graphical interface where users can upload single images, see immediate processing results, and visualize the effects of our preprocessing techniques. <br>
